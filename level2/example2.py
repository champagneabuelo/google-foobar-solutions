# current approach:
# implement subtraction with differnt base numbers
# utilize that function to continuously iterate new keys
# once a value is reached that already exists in the list, stop and return the length of list
def sort_string(string):
    # params: string of id
    # return: tuple with sorted number ascending and descending

def substraction(x, y, base):
    # params: numbers to be substracted, and base of number
    # return: difference in base that was originally given 

def answer(n, b):
    # params: takes initial string of k length, and base of number
